# File Read & Write Challenge üñãÔ∏è

## üìå Overview
This Python program demonstrates **file handling** and **error handling**.  
It reads the contents of a file provided by the user, modifies the content (by converting it to uppercase), and then writes the modified version to a new file.

If the input file does not exist or cannot be read, the program will display an appropriate error message.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- Reads text content from a user-specified file.
- Modifies the content (example: converts all text to uppercase).
- Writes the modified content to a new file with a `modified_` prefix.
- Includes error handling for:
  - Missing files (`FileNotFoundError`).
  - Read/Write issues (`IOError`).
